# Tip Calculator
A simple tip calculator created using vanilla JS, with styling from Bootstrap.

Tip value will update dynamically whenever any of the input fields change - results are rounded to 2dp. The 'number of people' field is optional.

The 'tip per person' element is hidden if the value is Â£0 NaN or infinity to keep it looking clean.
