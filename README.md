# Tip Calculator

https://ksells99.github.io/tip-calculator/

A simple tip calculator created using vanilla JS, with styling from Bootstrap.

Tip value will update dynamically whenever any of the input fields change - results are rounded to 2dp. The 'number of people' field is optional.

The 'tip per person' element is hidden if the 'number of people' field is left empty, or if the value is Â£0, NaN or infinity (only occurs if the total bill value is tiny anyway) to keep it looking clean.
